# Bookmark-Based-Noodle-Extensions
Ok, basically I'm trying something out. I have ideas for making a general script for making Noodle Extensions maps. What I'm trying to do is use bookmarks the open and close a section for notes to be modified with certain animations and such. I don't have any experience with noodle before starting this project, so I have no idea if this is either useful or possible. I might use the modulecreated by megamaz found here: https://github.com/megamaz/NoodleExtensions-python to do the effects. Frankly, I have no idea yet.

For now, book marks will need the notation "/ effect duration other things needed for the effect". Hopefully this will be possible in MMA2, CM, and beatmapper. You'll need to move the difficulty file into the same folder as all the needed code to run this, if I ever finish it.
